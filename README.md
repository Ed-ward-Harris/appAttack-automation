## For Devs
> Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/Ed-ward-Harris/appAttack-automation/blob/main/documentation.md)
You're better off running ./main for testing additions to the tool. Otherwise you have to rebuild it each time to test. Make sure you also reinstall to make sure the install process isn't broken. 

### To reinstall 
1. **Remove the original installation**:
   > *This isn't strictly necessary all the time, but it's just simpler to always do it.*
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /opt/appAttack_toolkit
   sudo rm /usr/local/bin/appAttack_toolkit

2. **Reinstall**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
